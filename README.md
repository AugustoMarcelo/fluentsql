FluentSQL is an application developed in order to study project patterns like Builder and Fluent Interface. This project is an util library that access and manipulates database through commands like _select_, _where_, _orderby_, _limit_.

For this project, we have used jest to perform tests and ECMAScript Modules. I'm running this project on Windows, so I needed to install the `cross-env` library in order to set environment variables and run the jest tests.
